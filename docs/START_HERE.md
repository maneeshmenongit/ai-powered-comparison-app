### For Data Engineers (Like You!)

You already have many of the foundational skills, so you can move faster:

**Week 1: Core AI Skills**
✅ Skip basic Python (you know this)
✅ Skip data structures (you know this)
✅ Skip JSON handling (you know this)
✅ Skip database basics (you know this)

🆕 Focus on:
- OpenAI API basics (2-3 hours)
- Prompt engineering (3-4 hours)
- LangChain fundamentals (3-4 hours)

**Week 2-3: Integration**
- Real API integration (you've done this before, just new APIs)
- Data normalization (classic ETL, you know this)
- Caching strategies (you've done this)

**Week 4: Advanced**
- Jump straight to web UI or intelligence features
- You can parallelize learning since you have the foundation

**Your timeline**: Probably 4-6 weeks instead of 8 weeks

## 🎓 Learning Strategy

### The "Build to Learn" Approach

Instead of reading everything first, use this cycle:

1. **Run** → Execute the POC
2. **Break** → Modify something and see what breaks
3. **Fix** → Figure out how to fix it
4. **Learn** → Read the docs to understand why
5. **Repeat** → Try the next modification

This is how engineers actually learn - by doing!

---

### Key Milestones

**Milestone 1**: POC runs successfully
- ✅ You understand how AI parsing works
- ✅ You can modify prompts
- ✅ You see the complete flow

**Milestone 2**: Real API integration
- ✅ You've signed up for Uber/Lyft APIs
- ✅ You can make authenticated requests
- ✅ You handle errors gracefully

**Milestone 3**: Web interface
- ✅ Streamlit app is running
- ✅ Users can interact via browser
- ✅ Results display nicely

**Milestone 4**: Intelligence
- ✅ App remembers conversation context
- ✅ Personalized recommendations work
- ✅ Learning from user behavior

---

## 💡 Why This Project is Perfect for Learning

### 1. **Practical and Personal**
You'll actually use this tool! It solves a real problem you face when comparing services.

### 2. **Incremental Complexity**
- Phase 1: Simple (just AI + mock data)
- Phase 2: Medium (real APIs)
- Phase 3: Medium (web UI)
- Phase 4: Advanced (intelligence)

You can stop at any phase and have something useful.

### 3. **Transferable Skills**

- ✅ Same: API integration (Snowflake, Zuora)
- ✅ Same: Alerting and reporting

**Tax Filing Agent**:
- ✅ Same: Document parsing
- ✅ Same: Rule application with AI
- ✅ Same: Data validation

### 4. **Low Cost**
- OpenAI API: ~$5-10 for entire learning project
- No paid subscriptions needed
- Free tier APIs available for testing

### 5. **Portfolio Piece**
By the end, you'll have:
- Working application
